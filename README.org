Cassiopeia is a statically typed purely functional programming
language. It looks like a Lisp but it ain't one. Why ? I had to choose
between static typing and homoiconicity, and I chosed the former. It
looks like a Lisp because I am just too lazy to think about a decent
syntax and because I like it the way it is.

+ Slow.
+ Probably bug-ridden.
+ Running on a virtual machine
+ Purely functional as it only has pure values
